## üìã Architecture Principles

The system follows these key architectural principles:

### Modular Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together

### Security First
- **Context Bridge**: Secure IPC communication between processes
- **No Direct Node.js Access**: Renderer process has controlled API surface
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated

### Performance Optimized
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent caching with TTL and invalidation
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent operations where possible
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration test coverage
- **Clear Documentation**: Self-documenting code with detailed guides
- **Debugging Tools**: Integrated debugging and development aids

These principles ensure the system is maintainable, secure, performant, and developer-friendly.
