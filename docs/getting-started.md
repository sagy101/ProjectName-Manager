# Getting Started & Installation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up and running {ProjectName} Manager.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS (tested), Linux (expected to work)
- **Node.js**: Version 22.16.0 (required for the Electron app)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and managing project repositories
- **npm or yarn**: Package manager

### Important Note on Node.js Versions

- **Electron App**: Requires Node.js 22.16.0
- **Managed Projects**: The Isolation Project commands that run in the terminals may require Node.js 15 or 16, depending on the specific project configuration

I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node.js versions:

```bash
# Install nvm (if not already installed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Install and use Node.js 22.16.0 for the Electron app
nvm install 22.16.0
nvm use 22.16.0

# The app will handle switching Node versions for managed projects
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagy101/ProjectName-Manager.git
cd ProjectName-Manager
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Ensure you're using Node.js 22.16.0
nvm use 22.16.0

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Rebuild Native Modules

The application uses native modules (like `node-pty`) that need to be rebuilt for Electron:

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

This step is crucial for terminal functionality to work properly.

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application should launch and display the main window.

## Development Setup

### Running in Development Mode

For active development with automatic rebuilding:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for file changes and rebuild
npm run watch

# Terminal 2: Run the application
npm start
```

### Building for Development

To manually build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (Jest + E2E)
npm test

# Run only Jest tests
npm run test:jest

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:jest:coverage:html
```

## First-Time Configuration

When you first launch {ProjectName} Manager, you'll need to:

### 1. Review Environment Verification

The application will automatically check for required tools and dependencies:
- Look at the "General Environment" section
- Red indicators show missing or misconfigured tools
- Click "Fix" buttons to automatically install/configure tools

### 2. Configure Your Project Sections

Each section in the sidebar represents a project or service:
- Enable sections you want to use
- Select deployment modes (Container/Process)
- Configure any dropdown options

### 3. Run Auto Setup (Optional)

For a quick environment setup:
1. Click the wrench icon (ðŸ”§) in the App Control Sidebar
2. Review the commands that will be executed
3. Click "Start Auto Setup"
4. Monitor progress and address any failures

### 4. Start Your Configuration

Once everything is configured:
- Click "Run {ProjectName}" to start all enabled services
- Monitor the terminal tabs for each service
- Use the Health Report to view overall system status

## Common Setup Issues

### Terminal Not Working

If terminals show errors or don't display output:

```bash
# Rebuild node-pty for Electron
npm run rebuild

# If still having issues, try:
npx @electron/rebuild -f -w node-pty
```

### Permission Errors

Some operations may require elevated permissions:
- Fix commands that install system tools may need sudo
- Docker operations require Docker daemon to be running
- File operations need appropriate directory permissions

### Missing Dependencies

If verifications fail:
1. Check the specific error message
2. Use the "Fix" button if available
3. Or manually install the required tool
4. Re-run verification to confirm

### Platform-Specific Notes

**macOS**:
- Homebrew is often used for tool installation
- Some tools may require Xcode Command Line Tools

**Linux**:
- Package manager varies by distribution
- May need to adjust fix commands for your package manager
