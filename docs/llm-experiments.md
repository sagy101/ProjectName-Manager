# AI Coding Experiment

This project is my exploration of "vibe coding" mixed with solid engineering practices and some good old coding. I leverage several AI tools and language models to streamline development, each chosen for their specific strengths and use cases.

## Development Platforms

- **Cursor** – my main development platform for rapid prototyping, real-time AI assistance, and quick code edits.
- **Windsurf** – used primarily for its "preview" feature to inspect and adjust HTML elements easily. The preview mode allows real-time visual editing where you can click on UI elements to modify them directly, making frontend development much more intuitive.
- **Google Jules** – my go-to for project-wide but small changes. Excels at understanding entire codebases and making consistent updates across multiple files.
- **Firebase Studio** – Google's full-stack AI development environment. Excellent for rapid prototyping and deployment of UI heavy features.

## AI Coding Assistants

- **OpenAI Codex** – my go-to for small features and documentation validation. Exceptional at generating boilerplate code and ensuring documentation accuracy.
- **GitHub Copilot** – inline code completion and suggestions during active development.
- **Replit Ghostwriter** – cloud-based coding with instant execution and deployment.

## Language Models

### Cutting-Edge Models (2024-2025)

- **Claude 4 Opus** – Anthropic's flagship model with exceptional reasoning for complex coding tasks and architectural decisions. Best for multi-file refactoring and system design.
- **Claude 4 Sonnet** – the balanced option with strong coding performance at lower cost. Excellent for everyday development tasks and code reviews.
- **GPT-4.1** – OpenAI's latest with improved instruction following and coding accuracy. Great for multimodal tasks and rapid iteration.
- **GPT-4.5** – enhanced reasoning model with unified capabilities. Ideal for complex problem-solving and algorithm design.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** – currently ranked #1 across coding benchmarks. Massive 1M+ token context window allows processing entire codebases. Excellent for large-scale analysis and refactoring.
- **o3-mini** – OpenAI's fast reasoning model, perfect for real-time code suggestions and quick debugging sessions.
- **DeepSeek R1** – open-source reasoning model, extremely cost-effective for coding and mathematics. Up to 30x cheaper than comparable models.
- **Grok 3** – xAI's model with superior reasoning and real-time data access via X integration. Great for research and technical problem-solving.

### Specialized Models

- **Claude Sonnet 3.7** – hybrid reasoning model that adapts speed based on task complexity. Excellent for both quick queries and deep analysis.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** – Google's multimodal model optimized for real-time interactions. Perfect for UI analysis and visual debugging.
- **GPT-4o** – fast multimodal model ideal for image-based coding questions and rapid prototyping.

## Model Selection Strategy

Each model excels in different scenarios:

- **For complex architectural decisions and careful adjustments**: Claude 4 Opus
- **For large codebase analysis/refactoring**: Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M+ context window)
- **For cost-effective daily coding**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet or GPT-4.1
- **For real-time coding assistance**: o3-mini or GPT-4o or sonnet 4
- **For multimodal debugging (i.e screenshots)**: Gemini 2.5 Flash or GPT-o3

The key is matching the model's strengths to the specific task, balancing performance, cost, and speed based on project needs.
