# AI Coding Experiment

This project is also my exploration of "vibe coding" mixed with solid code practices. I leverage several AI tools and language models to streamline development and learn how they complement each other.

## Tools Used

- **Cursor** – rapid prototyping and quick code edits.
- **Windsurf** – managing large code bases and navigating complex files.
- **Google Jules** – assisting with documentation and code reviews.
- **Google Fire Studio** – quick UI mockups and visual tweaks.
- **OpenAI Codex** – generating boilerplate code and suggesting improvements.

## Language Models

- **ChatGPT 4.1** – a good balance of speed and reasoning for everyday coding tasks.
- **GPT‑4o** – fast iteration and UI generation with shorter response times.
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** – excels at large‑context, complex refactors.
- **Claude 4 Opus** – very strong understanding of nuanced prompts.
- **Claude 4 Sonnet** – concise answers and reliable summaries.

Each model was chosen for its strengths so their roles rarely overlap.
