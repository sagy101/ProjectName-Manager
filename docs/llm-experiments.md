# AI Coding Experiment

This project is my exploration of "vibe coding" mixed with solid engineering practices and some good old coding. I leverage several AI tools and language models to streamline development, each chosen for their specific strengths and use cases.

## Development Platforms

- **Cursor** – my main development platform for rapid prototyping, real-time AI assistance, and quick code edits.
- **Windsurf** – used primarily for its "preview" feature to inspect and adjust HTML elements easily. The preview mode allows real-time visual editing where you can click on UI elements to modify them directly, making frontend development much more intuitive.
- **Firebase Studio** – Google's full-stack AI development environment. Excellent for rapid prototyping and deployment of UI heavy features.

## AI Coding Assistants

- **OpenAI Codex** – my go-to for small features and documentation validation. Exceptional at generating boilerplate code and ensuring documentation accuracy.
- **Google Jules** – my go-to for project-wide but small changes. Excels at understanding entire codebases and making consistent updates across multiple files.

Both were used to create jest and playwright tests.

## Model Selection Strategy

Each model serves a different role:

- **Claude 4 Opus or GPT-o3** – write requirements, plan development, and tackle complex bugs.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** – large context for big refactors with strong vision for visual changes.
- **Claude 4 Sonnet or GPT-4.1** – go-to models for everyday feature coding and debugging.
- **GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet** – extremely fast for tab completion and quick assistance.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** – optimized for real-time interactions and UI analysis.

The key is matching the model's strengths to the task. This strategy works well.
