# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd {project-name}-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild native modules for Electron
npm run rebuild

# Start the application
npm start

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

{ProjectName} Manager uses a modular JSON-based configuration system. All configurations are stored in the `src/` directory:

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration Files Overview</strong></summary>

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `generalEnvironmentVerifications.json` | General environment tool verifications with header configuration |
| `configurationSidebarSections.json` | UI structure, components, dropdown selectors, custom buttons, and display settings (like `projectName`) |
| `configurationSidebarAbout.json` | Section descriptions, verifications, and "About" info for floating terminal commands |
| `configurationSidebarCommands.json` | Command generation logic for main sections and floating terminal custom buttons |

</details>

### Key Configuration Concepts

- **Sections**: Logical groupings of related functionality (e.g., frontend, backend, cloud)
- **Verifications**: Checks for required tools, paths, or environment variables
- **Commands**: Dynamic command generation based on configuration state for main tasks and floating terminals
- **Components**: UI elements like toggles, buttons, and dropdowns
- **Custom Buttons**: Buttons within sections that can trigger actions, typically opening a floating terminal with a specific command
- **Dropdown Selectors**: Generic command-driven dropdowns with dependency support
- **Header Configuration**: Configurable environment section headers with integrated controls
- **Test Sections**: Sections marked for development/testing that can be hidden/shown via debug tools. Commands from hidden test sections are excluded from "Run {ProjectName}"

### Custom Buttons & Floating Terminals
You can add `customButton` entries to sections in `configurationSidebarSections.json`. These buttons can execute predefined commands (from `configurationSidebarCommands.json`) in new **floating terminals**. These terminals are draggable, resizable, have minimize/close buttons, and are managed via the **App Control Sidebar**.

See [docs/configuration-guide.md](docs/configuration-guide.md) for details on configuring `customButton` and linking them to commands and "About" information.

## üîß Adding New Sections

Adding a new section requires updating three JSON files. No code changes needed! Both top-level sections and their sub-sections can have their own command definitions in `configurationSidebarCommands.json` to open dedicated terminal tabs. Custom buttons can also be added to trigger floating terminals.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong></summary>

### 1. Add UI Structure (`configurationSidebarSections.json`)

Define the main section, any sub-sections, and components like `customButton`.

```json
{
  "displaySettings": {
    "projectName": "YourProject"
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "your-main-section",
      "title": "Your Main Section",
      "components": {
        "toggle": true,
        "infoButton": true,
        "gitBranch": true,
        "deploymentOptions": ["container", "process"],
        "modeSelector": {
          "options": ["development", "staging", "production"],
          "default": "development"
        },
        "attachToggle": {
          "enabled": true,
          "mutuallyExclusiveWith": ["other-section-id"]
        },
        "subSections": [
          {
            "id": "your-subsection-id",
            "title": "My Sub-Section with Dropdown",
            "components": {
              "toggle": true,
              "dropdownSelectors": [
                {
                  "id": "mySubDropdown",
                  "command": "echo \"SubOption1\nSubOption2\"",
                  "placeholder": "Select sub option..."
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ],
        "logsButton": true,
        "customButton": {
          "id": "myCustomLogButton",
          "label": "View Specific Logs",
          "commandId": "myCustomLogCommand"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Add Description and Verifications (`configurationSidebarAbout.json`)

Provide "About" info for your `customButton`'s `commandId` if it opens a floating terminal.

```json
{
  "sectionId": "your-main-section",
  "directoryPath": "your-main-section",
  "description": "Description of what this section does and its purpose.",
  "verifications": [
    {
      "id": "yourSectionDirExists",
      "title": "./your-main-section directory exists",
      "checkType": "pathExists",
      "pathValue": "./your-main-section",
      "pathType": "directory"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "sectionId": "myCustomLogCommand",
  "description": "Displays specific logs for My Custom Log Button.",
  "verifications": []
}
```

### 3. Add Command Logic (`configurationSidebarCommands.json`)

Define commands for main sections and for `customButton` actions.

```json
[
  {
    "sectionId": "your-section",
    "conditions": {
      "enabled": true,
      "deploymentType": "container"
    },
    "command": {
      "base": "cd your-section && docker-compose up",
      "prefix": "nvm use 15.5.1 && ",
      "tabTitle": "Your Section (Container)"
    }
  },
  {
    "sectionId": "your-section", 
    "conditions": {
      "enabled": true,
      "deploymentType": "process"
    },
    "command": {
      "base": "cd your-section && npm start",
      "prefix": "nvm use 15.5.1 && ",
      "tabTitle": "Your Section (Process)"
    }
  },
  {
    "sectionId": "myCustomLogCommand",
    "command": {
      "base": "tail -f /var/log/specific.log",
      "tabTitle": "Specific Logs"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Full Example with All Features

```json
{
  "sectionId": "your-main-section-or-subsection-id", // Can be a top-level sectionId or a subSectionId
  "conditions": {
    "enabled": true,
    "deploymentType": "container"
  },
  "command": {
    "base": "cd your-section && docker-compose up",
    "associatedContainers": [
      "container-name-1",
      "container-name-2",
      { "name": "conditional-container", "condition": "deploymentType === 'container'" }
    ],
    "postModifiers": " --verbose",
    "prefix": "nvm use 15.5.1 && ",
    "tabTitle": {
      "base": "Your Main Section",
      "conditionalAppends": [
        {
          "condition": "mode === 'development'",
          "append": " (Dev)"
        },
        {
          "condition": "mode === 'staging'",
          "append": " (Staging)"
        }
      ]
    },
    "refreshConfig": {
      "prependCommands": [
        {
          "command": "make build && ",
          "condition": "needsRebuild === true"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** For sections with complex conditions or commands that differ significantly between modes (like `url-intelligence-sub`), use separate command objects instead of modifiers to avoid JavaScript evaluation errors.

### 4. Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir your-main-section
cd your-main-section
git init
# Add your project files
```

</details>

### Component Options

<details>
<summary><strong>Available Components</strong></summary>

| Component | Description | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `toggle` | Main enable/disable toggle | `true/false` |
| `infoButton` | Shows section description | `true/false` |
| `gitBranch` | Git branch switcher | `true/false` |
| `deploymentOptions` | Deployment mode selector | Array of strings |
| `modeSelector` | Multi-option mode selector | `{ options: [], default: "" }` |
