# {ProjectName} Manager

> **Note:** The Electron app requires Node.js **22.16.0**. Terminal commands for the Isolation projects can run on Node.js **15** or **16**. It is recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node.js versions. Once you have `nvm` installed, you can run `nvm use` in the project directory to automatically switch to the correct version for the Electron runtime.

> The application has been tested on **macOS**. It should also work on **Linux**, though this has not been verified. Windows compatibility is not planned at this time.

A powerful, modular desktop application for managing Project environments with integrated terminal support, environment verification, and dynamic configuration management.

This project is also an experiment in "vibe coding" mixed with solid code practices. I explored a variety of AI tools and language models to see how they complement traditional development. Details can be found in the [AI Coding Experiment](docs/llm-experiments.md) document.

npm run watch

# In another terminal, start the app
npm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

{ProjectName} Manager uses a modular JSON-based configuration system. All configurations are stored in feature-specific directories within `src/`:

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration Files Overview</strong></summary>

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/environment-verification/generalEnvironmentVerifications.json` | General environment tool verifications with header configuration |
| `src/project-config/config/configurationSidebarSections.json` | UI structure, components, dropdown selectors, custom buttons, and application settings (appearance, behavior, limits) |
| `src/project-config/config/configurationSidebarAbout.json` | Section descriptions, verifications, and "About" info for floating terminal commands |
| `src/project-config/config/configurationSidebarCommands.json` | Command generation logic for main sections and floating terminal custom buttons |

</details>

### Key Configuration Concepts

- **Sections**: Logical groupings of related functionality (e.g., frontend, backend, cloud)
- **Verifications**: Checks for required tools, paths, or environment variables
- **Commands**: Dynamic command generation based on configuration state for main tasks and floating terminals
- **Components**: UI elements like toggles, buttons, and dropdowns
- **Custom Buttons**: Buttons within sections that can trigger actions, typically opening a floating terminal with a specific command
- **Dropdown Selectors**: Generic command-driven dropdowns with dependency support
- **Header Configuration**: Configurable environment section headers with integrated controls
- **Test Sections**: Sections marked for development/testing that can be hidden/shown via debug tools. Commands from hidden test sections are excluded from "Run {ProjectName}"

### Custom Buttons & Floating Terminals
You can add `customButton` entries to sections in `configurationSidebarSections.json`. These buttons can execute predefined commands (from `configurationSidebarCommands.json`) in new **floating terminals**. These terminals are draggable, resizable, have minimize/close buttons, and are managed via the **App Control Sidebar**.

See [docs/configuration-guide.md](docs/configuration-guide.md) for details on configuring `customButton` and linking them to commands and "About" information.

## üîß Adding New Sections

Adding a new section requires updating three JSON files. No code changes needed! Both top-level sections and their sub-sections can have their own command definitions in `configurationSidebarCommands.json` to open dedicated terminal tabs. Custom buttons can also be added to trigger floating terminals.

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong></summary>

### 1. Add UI Structure (`configurationSidebarSections.json`)

Define the main section, any sub-sections, and components like `customButton`.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "projectName": "YourProject"
    // Additional settings available - see Configuration Guide for complete list
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "your-main-section",
      "title": "Your Main Section",
      "components": {
        "toggle": true,
        "infoButton": true,
        "gitBranch": true,
        "deploymentOptions": true,
        "modeSelector": {
          "options": ["run", "suspend"],
          "labels": ["Run", "Suspend"],
          "default": "suspend"
        },
        "attachToggle": {
          "enabled": true,
          "mutuallyExclusiveWith": ["other-section-id"]
        },
        "subSections": [
          {
            "id": "your-subsection-id",
            "title": "My Sub-Section with Dropdown",
            "components": {
              "toggle": true,
              "dropdownSelectors": [
                {
                  "id": "mySubDropdown",
                  "command": "echo \"SubOption1\nSubOption2\"",
                  "placeholder": "Select sub option..."
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ],
        "logsButton": true,
        "customButton": {
          "id": "myCustomLogButton",
          "label": "View Specific Logs",
          "commandId": "myCustomLogCommand"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Add Description and Verifications (`configurationSidebarAbout.json`)

Provide "About" info for your `customButton`'s `commandId` if it opens a floating terminal.

```json
{
  "sectionId": "your-main-section",
  "directoryPath": "your-main-section",
  "description": "Description of what this section does and its purpose.",
  "verifications": [
    {
      "id": "yourSectionDirExists",
      "title": "./your-main-section directory exists",
      "checkType": "pathExists",
      "pathValue": "./your-main-section",
      "pathType": "directory"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "sectionId": "myCustomLogCommand",
  "description": "Displays specific logs for My Custom Log Button.",
  "verifications": []
}
```

### 3. Add Command Logic (`configurationSidebarCommands.json`)

Define commands for main sections and for `customButton` actions.

```json
[
  {
    "sectionId": "your-section",
    "conditions": {
      "enabled": true,
      "deploymentType": "container"
    },
    "command": {
      "base": "cd your-section && docker-compose up",
      "prefix": "nvm use 16 && ",
      "tabTitle": "Your Section (Container)"
    }
  },
  {
    "sectionId": "your-section", 
    "conditions": {
      "enabled": true,
      "deploymentType": "process"
    },
    "command": {
      "base": "cd your-section && npm start",
      "prefix": "nvm use 16 && ",
      "tabTitle": "Your Section (Process)"
    }
  },
  {
    "sectionId": "myCustomLogCommand",
    "command": {
      "base": "tail -f /var/log/specific.log",
      "tabTitle": "Specific Logs"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Full Example with All Features

```json
{
  "sectionId": "your-main-section-or-subsection-id", // Can be a top-level sectionId or a subSectionId
  "conditions": {
    "enabled": true,
    "deploymentType": "container"
  },
  "command": {
    "base": "cd your-section && docker-compose up",
    "associatedContainers": [
      "container-name-1",
      "container-name-2",
      { "name": "conditional-container", "condition": "deploymentType === 'container'" }
    ],
    "postModifiers": " --verbose",
    "prefix": "nvm use 16 && ",
    "tabTitle": {
      "base": "Your Main Section",
      "conditionalAppends": [
        {
          "condition": "mode === 'development'",
          "append": " (Dev)"
        },
        {
          "condition": "mode === 'staging'",
          "append": " (Staging)"
        }
      ]
    },
    "refreshConfig": {
      "prependCommands": [
        {
          "command": "make build && ",
          "condition": "needsRebuild === true"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** For sections with complex conditions or commands that differ significantly between modes (like `url-intelligence-sub`), use separate command objects instead of modifiers to avoid JavaScript evaluation errors.

### 4. Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir your-main-section
cd your-main-section
git init
# Add your project files
```

</details>

## üîç Environment Verification

The verification system supports multiple check types for comprehensive environment validation, with optional auto-fix capabilities.

### Auto-Fix Commands

Failed verifications can include fix commands that automatically attempt to resolve issues:

```json
{
  "id": "mirrorDirExists",
  "title": "./weblifemirror directory exists",
  "checkType": "pathExists", 
  "pathValue": "./weblifemirror",
  "pathType": "directory",
  "fixCommand": "mkdir -p ./weblifemirror"
}
```

**Fix Command Features:**
- **One-Click Fix**: Orange "Fix" button appears next to invalid verifications
- **Confirmation Prompt**: Clicking "Fix" shows the command and asks for confirmation
- **Floating Terminal**: Fix commands run in dedicated floating terminals
- **Auto-Close**: Terminals close automatically when command completes (if minimized)
- **Re-Validation**: Verification automatically re-runs after fix completes
- **Safety Features**: Close button disabled for 20 seconds to prevent accidental closure
- **Smart Notifications**: Success/failure feedback after fix attempts



For complete verification reference, see [docs/verification-types.md](docs/verification-types.md).

## üöÄ Auto Setup

The Auto Setup feature provides one-click automated environment configuration by running all necessary fix commands in priority order.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies failed verifications with fix commands
- **Priority-Based Execution**: Sequential execution by priority groups (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Parallel Processing**: Commands within the same priority run simultaneously
- **Smart Terminals**: Dedicated floating terminals that start minimized
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates and progress monitoring
- **Failure Handling**: Stops on errors with individual retry options

### Quick Start

1. Click the Auto Setup button (üîß) in the App Control Sidebar
2. Review the organized command groups by priority
3. Click "Start Auto Setup" to begin automated execution
4. Monitor progress and handle any failures as needed

### Configuration

Add `fixPriority` to fix commands in your configuration files:

```json
{
  "fixCommand": "git clone https://github.com/...",
  "fixPriority": 1
}
```

**Priority Guidelines**: 1 (system tools) ‚Üí 2 (dev environments) ‚Üí 3 (cloud tools) ‚Üí 4 (project setup)

For complete setup instructions, configuration examples, and troubleshooting, see the [Auto Setup Guide](docs/auto-setup-guide.md).

## üíª Terminal Integration

{ProjectName} Manager provides a rich terminal experience.

### Main Terminals
- **Multiple Tabs**: For commands related to main configuration sections.
- **Read-Only by Default**: Input is disabled by default for safety. Can be enabled via debug tools.
- **Tab Information Panel**: Detailed info, command viewing, and conditional refresh.
- **Process & Container Management**: Lifecycle tied to tabs.

### Floating Terminals
- Typically launched by **Custom Buttons** in configuration sections (e.g., "View Logs").
- **Draggable & Resizable**: Windows can be moved and resized.
- **Minimize & Close**: Standard window controls.
- **Always Writable**: Input is enabled for interaction.
- **"No Run Mode" Aware**: Will display commands instead of executing if "No Run Mode" is active.
- Managed via the **App Control Sidebar**.

For detailed documentation on terminal features, see [Terminal Features Guide](docs/terminal-features.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è App Control Sidebar & Debug Tools
The **App Control Sidebar**, accessible from the right edge of the application, provides:
- **Auto Setup**: One-click automated environment setup (wrench icon)
- Management of active **Floating Terminals** (show, minimize, view "About" info, close)
- **Health Report**: Real-time status overview of all running services
- Access to **Debug Tools** via a gear icon at the bottom

When any debug options are active, the gear icon will show an orange border.

### Debug Tools Features (within App Control Sidebar)

**Developer Utilities**
- **Open Dev Tools**: Opens Chrome Developer Tools.
- **Reload App**: Reloads the entire application.
- **Export Environment**: Exports comprehensive environment verification data including command outputs and system information.
- **Toggle All Verifications**: Toggles all visible verification statuses between valid/invalid for testing purposes.
  - If any verifications are invalid, sets all to valid. Otherwise sets all to invalid.
  - Only affects verifications from visible sections (respects test section visibility).

**Visibility Options**
- **Show/Hide Test Sections**: Toggle visibility of sections marked `testSection: true`.
  - Hidden by default. Commands from hidden test sections are excluded when "Run {ProjectName}" is pressed.

**Execution Modes**
- **No Run Mode**: Commands are displayed but not executed in both main and floating terminals.
- **Terminal Input Mode**: Toggle the main tabbed terminals between read-only (default) and writable. Disabled when a {ProjectName} configuration is running.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building

```bash
# Development build
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```

### Native Module Rebuilding

After installing new native dependencies:

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Common Issues</strong></summary>

### Terminal Not Working
- Ensure `node-pty` is properly rebuilt: `npm run rebuild`
- Check that your shell is properly configured
- Verify PTY permissions on your system

### Verification Failures
- Check that required tools are installed and in PATH
- Verify JSON configuration syntax
- Review console logs for detailed error messages

### Logging System
The application uses a centralized logging system that automatically adjusts based on environment:

- **Production**: Only critical errors are logged
- **Development**: All log levels are shown (errors, warnings, info, debug)  
- **Override Control**: Use `DEBUG_LOGS` environment variable for explicit control

**Example:**
```bash
DEBUG_LOGS=true npm start    # Force all logs (including debug)
DEBUG_LOGS=false npm start   # Reduce to info level only
npm start                    # Use environment defaults
```

All logs include timestamps, module prefixes, and appropriate log levels for easy filtering and debugging.

### Git Integration Issues
- Ensure git is installed and configured
- Check repository initialization in project directories
- Verify branch permissions and remote access

### Test Sections Not Showing
- Open debug panel (gear icon)
- Click "Show Test Sections" button
- Test sections are hidden by default

### Main Terminals Not Accepting Input
- Main terminals are read-only by default.
- Enable input via Debug Tools: App Control Sidebar -> Gear Icon -> "Terminals Read-Only" button. This is disabled if a {ProjectName} configuration is running.

## Configuration Export/Import

The application supports exporting and importing your complete configuration, including:

- **Section Settings**: Which sections are enabled/disabled
- **Deployment Types**: Container vs Process deployment modes
- **Mode Selections**: Development, staging, production modes
- **Dropdown Values**: Selected cloud projects, kubectl contexts, etc.
- **Attach States**: Debug attach configurations
- **Git Branches**: Current git branch for each service (NEW!)

### How to Export Configuration

1. Click the **Export Config** button in the app control sidebar (right side)
2. Choose a location to save your configuration file
3. The exported JSON will include all current settings and git branches

### How to Export Environment Data

1. Click the **Export Environment** button in the app control sidebar (right side)
2. The app will generate a comprehensive JSON file containing:
   - Platform information (OS type, release, architecture)
   - All environment verification results (valid/invalid status)
   - Command outputs from verification checks
   - Discovered tool versions
   - Timestamp of the export
3. This is useful for debugging environment issues or sharing system state

### How to Import Configuration

1. Click the **Import Config** button in the app control sidebar
2. Select a previously exported configuration file
3. The app will:
   - Restore all configuration settings
   - Attempt to switch each service to its saved git branch
   - Show a notification with the results of branch switching

### Git Branch Import Behavior

When importing a configuration with git branches:

- ‚úÖ **Success**: If the branch exists and checkout succeeds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Success**: Some branches switch successfully, others fail
- ‚ùå **Failure**: Branch doesn't exist or git errors occur

The notification will show the count of successful vs total branch switches, e.g.:
- `Configuration imported with all git branches switched (4/4)`
- `Configuration imported with some git branches switched (2/4)`
- `Configuration imported but git branch switching failed`

### Example Exported Configuration

```json
{
  "configState": {
    "mirror": {
      "enabled": true,
      "mode": "suspend",
      "deploymentType": "container"
    }
  },
  "attachState": {
    "mirror": false
  },
  "globalDropdownValues": {
    "gcloudProject": "my-project-dev"
  },
  "gitBranches": {
    "mirror": "feature/new-api",
    "gopm": "main",
    "rule-engine": "develop"
  }
}
```

This ensures your entire development environment can be quickly replicated across different machines or shared with team members.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Health Report

The **Health Report** provides a comprehensive, real-time overview of all running services and their dependencies. It is accessible via a status indicator button in the App Control Sidebar.

- **Centralized Status Monitoring**: View the status of all main terminal processes and their associated Docker containers in a single, unified view.
- **Combined Health Status**: The header for each service displays a combined health status, calculated from the state of both the main process and its container dependencies. This provides a more holistic, at-a-glance understanding of each service's health.
- **Detailed Sub-Status**: Inside each section, the report shows the specific status of the main terminal process, as well as the individual statuses of all associated containers.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The report automatically refreshes every few seconds to provide a live view of your environment's health.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - **Focus Tab**: Immediately jump to the relevant terminal tab for a specific service.
  - **Show Command**: View the exact command being run in the terminal.
  - **Refresh**: Manually re-run the command for a specific service.

For more details on the Health Report's features and status calculations, see the [Health Report Guide](docs/health-report.md).
